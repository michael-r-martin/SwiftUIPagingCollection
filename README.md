# SwiftUIPagingCollection

Vertical scrolling content has taken over the internet. SwiftUI has taken over mobile app development. However... SwiftUI only has support for truly paging vertical content from iOS 17 and above. This is a problem!
                                                                                                                                                
SwiftUIPagingCollection is a Swift package that provides easy integration of a paging collection view into any SwiftUI application
It's fully generic, and capable of taking any data type as the collection data, and any view models for both the cell, and the parent
Several ScrollView delegate methods are already implemented, allowing fine-grained control of the scroll view (something that even iOS 17 does not support)

## Features
- Easy to use
- Highly customizable
- Supports iOS 14 and above

Add the package using SPM and the following URL:
